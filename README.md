# FULLSAIL UNIVERSITY: Assignment: Testing Your Own Codebase
In this assignment, you will code out at least four (4) of the functions listed in the table below. Each function you successfully code will be worth 20% of your overall score. After coding out all four of your chosen functions, you will write functional tests for each one to verify the correct behavior under different use cases and input parameters.

## Functions To Draw From
You must implement at least four (4) of the functions listed in the table below. Each function is designed to test your understanding of JavaScript concepts, including loops, conditionals, and string/array manipulation.

## Function Name	
Description
- **sumOfArray(arr)**	Takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of all elements.
- **reverseString(str)**	Reverses the input string and returns the reversed result.
- **isPalindrome(str)**	Checks if the input string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
- **findMax(arr)**	Takes an array of numbers and returns the largest number.
- **capitalizeWords(str)**	
Accepts a string of words and returns a new version where each word is capitalized (only the first letter of each word).
- **countVowels(str)**	
Counts the number of vowels in a given string and returns the count.
- **purgeDuplicates(arr)**
Accepts an array of values, and returns a new array of values with any duplicate values removed from the resulting array. 

  

 

### The Plot Twist
To add a bit of a challenge, there's a plot twist for this week's activity. In addition to implementing 4 of the functions we've discussed, you'll also need to write functional tests for each of the 4 functions you've created. This was mentioned at the beginning of the assignment, so keep that in mind.

*Here’s the twist:*
I won’t be giving you any specific instructions on which tests to write or how to write them. Your task is to think about all the different scenarios and types of values that might be passed into your functions. You need to create tests that cover as many different cases as possible. Why? Because I’ll be testing your code with my own set of tests, and you won’t know what they are in advance. Your grade will be based on how many of my tests your functions pass or fail.

So, my advice: think deeply about the types of unexpected situations your code might face. For example, instead of passing reverseString() a normal string, I might pass it a number like 1 or even a negative number like -1. What happens then? Consider cases where you're given bad input or your code doesn’t produce the expected output.
